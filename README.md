# GitHub Collaboration

## Purpose
This GitHub repository serves as a hands-on exercise for demonstrating version control, forking, branching, and submitting pull requests. The assignment focuses on data encryption using Python scripts, where students will encrypt their personal details using a provided public key.

## Repository Contents
1. `encrypt.py`: Python script for data encryption using the provided public key (`public_key.pem`).
2. `public_key.pem`: The public key file used for encryption. Students will have access to this file for encrypting their personal details.
3. `README.md`: This file contains instructions on how to complete the assignment and demonstrates the steps required to fork, branch, encrypt data, and submit a pull request.

## Assignment Steps
1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
   - These instructions your forked repository will be called `SecureDataEncryption`

2. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   - On your local machine, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Clone your forked repository using the following command (replace `<your-forked-repo-url>` with your forked repository URL):
     ```
     git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
     ```
   - Change to the repository directory:
     ```
     cd SecureDataEncryption
     ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Create a new branch named `personal-details` using the following command:
     ```
     git checkout -b personal-details
     ```

4. **Setup Python Environment:**
   - Create a new Python environment using `conda` by running the following command (for Windows users):
     ```
     conda create --name crypto python=3.10
     ```

5. **Install Required Packages:**
   - Activate the newly created environment (for Windows users):
     ```
     conda activate crypto
     ```
   - Install the required packages using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Encrypt Personal Details:**
   - Run the `encrypt.py` script to encrypt your personal details (name, email, student ID) using the provided public key:
     ```
     python encrypt.py
     ```
   - The encrypted output will be displayed on the console.

7. **Save Encrypted Output to a File (Safe Option):**
   - Run the `encrypt.py` script and enter your personal details when prompted.
   - After running the script, the encrypted output will be displayed on the console.
   - Copy the entire encrypted output string from the console.
   - Create a text file named `<github-username>.txt` in the root directory of the repository (replace `<github-username>` with your GitHub username).
   - Paste the copied encrypted output string into the `<github-username>.txt` file.
   - Save the file.

8. **Commit and Push:**
   - Commit your changes to the `personal-details` branch:
     ```
     git add <github-username>.txt
     git commit -m "Add encrypted personal details"
     ```
   - Push the branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
     ```
     git push origin personal-details
     ```

9. **Submit a Pull Request:**
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and switch to the `personal-details` branch.
   - Click on the "New pull request" button.
   - Submit the pull request to merge your changes into the main branch of the original repository.

**Note:**
- Do not include any unencrypted personal details or sensitive files in the repository 
- No one can decrypt your information without the private key.
- **The private key (`private_key.pem`).** is kept secure and is only used by the repository maintainer for verification.
- Your pull request will be reviewed, and any feedback or suggestions will be provided before merging it into the main branch.
